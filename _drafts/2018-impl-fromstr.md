I recently came across a head scratcher while working on a personal project
in Rust. I wasn't able to find a ready solution that suited me so I worked it
out on my own. Thought I'd share it because on one hand, it represents some
interesting behavior and on the other, it might help someone that
finds themselves in the same boat.

The general problem arose while exploring the `FromStr` trait. I wanted to
implement it for my own type but ran into a pesky issue. Implementing the
`FromStr` trait for my type required that applications using my library include
a `use std::str::FromStr;` to actually use it. Lets get started with some
context. This hadn't been my experience with implementing traits in the past,
the `Display` and  `Iterator` traits for example have no such corresponding
requirement.

Lets call my libary `from_str_example` and boil things down into the `FromStr`
trait as follows.

## Part 1: TypeV1

<pre>
<code class='rust'>use std::str::FromStr;
use std::string::ParseError;

pub struct TypeV1 {
    my_string: String,
}

impl FromStr for TypeV1 {
    type Err = ParseError;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        Ok(Self { my_string: String::from(s) })
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

From here an application that uses my `from_str_example` crate might assume
the following will work (I did).


<pre>
<code class='rust'>extern crate from_str_example;
use from_str_example::TypeV1;

fn main() {
    let var = TypeV1::from_str(
        "Today my winged horse is coming").unwrap();
}
</code>
</pre>

But it doesn't work! Trying to compile results in the following errors:

<pre>
<code class='bash'>Compiling myapp v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/my/app)
error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `from_str` found for type `from_str::TypeV1` in the current scope
  --> src/main.rs:18:16
   |
18 |     let test = TypeV1::from_str(
   |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function or associated item not found in `from_str::TypeV1`
   |
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
help: the following trait is implemented but not in scope, perhaps add a `use` for it:
   |
3  | use std::str::FromStr;
   |

error: aborting due to previous error

error: Could not compile `myapp`.
</code>
</pre>

Okay. I trust the compiler. Lets add the `use` it recommends.

<pre>
<code class='rust'>extern crate from_str_example;
use from_str_example::TypeV1;

use std::str::FromStr;

fn main() {
    let var = TypeV1::from_str(
        "Today my winged horse is coming").unwrap();
}
</code>
</pre>

And it works! But wait... I don't want to require that `use`. I want `from_str`
to just work for `TypeV1` without requiring anything beyond my library. Okay,
time to rethink. I can just implement my _own_ `from_str` for my type.

## Part 2: TypeV2

So after a revsion, that we'll note by using `TypeV2` in this section, we have
the following code in our libary.

<pre>
<code class='rust'>
use std::string::ParseError;

pub struct TypeV2 {
    my_string: String,
}

impl TypeV2 {
    pub fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, ParseError> {
        Ok(Self { my_string: String::from(s) })
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

And voila, the following works just like I'd hoped...

<pre>
<code class='rust'>
extern crate from_str_example;
use from_str_example::TypeV2;

fn main() {
    let var: TypeV2 = TypeV2::from_str(
        "and I am carrying you off to the moon").unwrap();
}
</code>
</pre>

Or rather, worked as I'd hoped _briefly_. My next issue arose when I wanted
to write a generic function that expected the `FromStr` trait. Lets reduce
that function to an example. Forgive me the `where` clause, my intent is to
provide as example, some code with meaningful output. If you decide you'd like
to experiment, feel free to remove the `println!`s and revise the
signature to `pub fn generic_print_function<T: FromStr>()`

<pre>
<code class='rust'>
use std::str::FromStr;
use std::fmt::Debug;

pub fn generic_print_function<T: FromStr + Debug>(var: T)
    where <T as std::str::FromStr>::Err: std::fmt::Debug
{
    let from_str_result = T::from_str("Wear your boots if you wander today");
    println!("{:?}", var);
    println!("{:?}", from_str_result);
}
</code>
</pre>

Now a user of the `from_str_example` crate is back to compile errors!

<pre>
<code class='rust'>
extern crate from_str_example;
use from_str_example::TypeV2;

fn main() {
    let var: TypeV2 = TypeV2::from_str(
        "and I am carrying you off to the moon").unwrap();
    generic_print_function(var);
}
</code>
</pre>

The above example results in the following compile error:

<pre>
<code class='bash'>Compiling from_str v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/my/app)
Compiling myapp v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/my/app)
error[E0277]: the trait bound `from_str::TypeV2: std::str::FromStr` is not satisfied
  --> src/main.rs:27:5
   |
27 |     generic_print_function(var);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `std::str::FromStr` is not implemented for `from_str::TypeV2`
   |
   = note: required by `from_str::generic_print_function`

error: aborting due to previous error

error: Could not compile `myapp`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
</code>
</pre>

Well damn, we just removed the implementation of `FromStr`. Desparate times,
they call for desparate measures.

## Part 3: TypeV3

I began the search engine and stack overflow answers dance. I'm not going to
claim that the answer isn't out there but I wasn't able to unearth one and
after enough time I started feeling devious.

Could I just implement `FromStr` _and_ `from_str` unique to my custom type?

As a seasoned C developer I'm accustomed to having to brace for impact when
it feels like I'm going out on a limb. But in Rust land, I've been
empowered by the "hack without fear" mantra. I'm less twitchy and more open to
looking for a fight because I've got the compiler at my back.

Here's my approach using using `TypeV3` to indicate the shift.

<pre>
<code class='rust'>
pub struct TypeV3 {
    my_string: String,
}

impl TypeV3 {
    pub fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, ParseError> {
        Ok(Self { my_string: String::from(s) })
    }
}

impl FromStr for TypeV3 {
    type Err = ParseError;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        Self::from_str(s)
    }
}

pub fn generic_print_function<T: FromStr + Debug>(var: T)
    where <T as std::str::FromStr>::Err: std::fmt::Debug
{
    let from_str_result = T::from_str("Wear your boots if you wander today");
    println!("{:?}", var);
    println!("{:?}", from_str_result);
}
</code>
</pre>

ðŸ™ƒ

It compiled! Lets see if it works...

<pre>
<code class='rust'>
extern crate from_str_example;
use from_str_example::TypeV3;

fn main() {
    let var = TypeV3::from_str(
        "and on the moon we will eat rose petals.").unwrap();
    generic_print_function(var);
}
</code>
</pre>

It does work! Recapping for anyone scanning for the words __fix__ or
__success__, implement the trait `FromStr` _as well as_ a function called
`from_str` for your custom type. This allows you to sidestep the requirement
that a user of your library has to add `use std::str::FromStr;` to their project
to use yours.

## Outline:

### Getting started.

[impl period](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-final-impl-period-newsletter/6408)

The work I did was for [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen),
[Property testing with quickcheck](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/1159),
[Quickchecking crate CLI](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/1177), and
[Enable Cargo features for quickchecking crate](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen/pull/1180).

First off, here's some context for things that went right and that may be out
of the ordinary.

    I live in Portland where there is a Mozilla presence.

    I was able to go to an impl period Meetup and pick 
    [@fitzgen](https://github.com/fitzgen)'s brain in person.

    I'd very recently been working on a personal Rust projet, the
    [bnf](https://github.com/snewt/bnf) crate
    that informed a lot of the work I was able to do for `bindgen`.

For things that I expect are more generalizable, some things that what went
right.

    The presence of a Gitter channel influenced my decision to contribute. I
    didn't actually use it much but it allowed me to wave and get a nod from a 
    maintainer. It was some human interaction that helped reinforce that my work
    would be seen.

    I went to an impl period Meetup and my engagement with the Rust community
    was enormously positive. Beyond the opportunity to pick the brain of a
    `bindgen` maintainer, I could pick the brain of others with experience in
    Rust and felt welcome as someone relatively new to the Rust space.

    When I was finally in a position that I felt warranted feedback and made a
    PR, I received incredibly thourough and thoughtful feedback. It empowered
    me to make my contribution much more robust.

Other notes:

Really great documentation that allowed me to browse targeted items.

I did feel intimidated at first at the ammount of docs but that probably
increased the likelyhood of me finding something that that resonated.

When I took on the project I had a clear idea of how to tackle it and that
clear idea was misguided haha.

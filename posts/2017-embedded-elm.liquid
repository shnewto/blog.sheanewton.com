<p>
I've been interested in dipping my toes into the Elm language for some time
and also, curious about whether it was possible / reasonable to integrate
something I wrote in Elm into the Cobalt site tooling.
<br><br>
Integration was trivial so major points to Cobalt.
<br><br>
Learning enough Elm to make something happen was the difficulty. I love
language learning tooling like <a href="http://exercism.io">exercism.io</a> so I started there.
Dusting off the functional programming brain was much less painful using their
examples and I'm a total sucker for getting tests to pass.
<br><br>
Next was asking for some guidance from <a href="https://twitter.com/CrockAgile">@CrockAgile</a>,
a friend with experience. He helped me a ton in sorting out the requirements
of implementing standalone Elm. Things like the following code block that
I'm likely to revisit for every Elm application I write.

<pre>
<code>
type Msg
    = NewInput String
    | Said


type alias Model =
    ( String, String )


main : Program Never Model Msg
main =
    Html.program
        { init = ( ( "", "" ), Cmd.none )
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = (\x -> Sub.none)
        }

</code>
</pre>

<br><br>
So here it is, an implementation of the
<a href="http://exercism.io/exercises/elm/bob/readme">Bob in Elm</a>
exercise from <a href="http://exercism.io">exercism.io</a> (source available
<a href="https://github.com/snewt/blog.sheanewton.com/blob/master/posts/Bob/Bob.elm">
here</a>).
</p>

<p>
<i>
Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
<br>
<li> Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
<br>
<li> He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.
<br>
<li> He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.
<br>
<li> He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

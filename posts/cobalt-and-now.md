Detailing the work of getting this blog put together using 
[cobalt.rs](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs) and deploying 
with [now](https://zeit.co/now).

### Time for a project
I've been thinking about (and putting off) getting a personal blog together for 
awhile but was honestly intimidated by what work might be involved. The
problem stemmed from indecision. 
A part of me leaned toward a nice prefab solution like 
[svbtle](https://svbtle.com/) or falling back to WordPress, 
something I'd toyed with in the past. But another part of me wanted to use a
personal blog project as an excuse to learn some new tooling and level up in 
areas that I don't have much experience. That part of me won out. 

I've had some positive experiences with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which made a 
lot of the work seem
approachable but I wanted to explore alternative options, namely what Rust had 
to offer in the arena. A quick browser search for "static site generator rust"
turns up a handful of options, but out of those, two seemed especially 
suited to what I was interested in. 
[Gutenberg](https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg) and 
[cobalt.rs](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs). 

### Decisions
The docs for both seemed approachable so I felt optimistic that either choice 
would be manageable with effort. Because my experience is especially slim in 
design, my choice ultimately came down to finding an existing site built with
either of the tools that had an aesthetic I liked and could pull from. 

[Matthias Endler's blog](https://matthias-endler.de/) sold me, it's beautiful. 
Walking through [that code base](https://github.com/mre/mre.github.io) was a 
fantastic tutorial on using cobalt.rs and _this_ site, especially
my CSS, leans pretty heavily on what I learned there.

### Lessons
Initially I didn't appreciate the __.md__ and __.liquid__ interchangeability. My 
first pass only used Markdown but then I wanted to incorporate styling... That's 
where the __.liquid__ extension comes in! It lets you incorporate raw HTML, 
and all the power that comes with it, into any page (which in my mind is magical 
CSS and JavaScript ha). I love that I'm not constrained to Markdown but have it 
in the toolbox.

### I built it, now what?
Okay, I dug in, hacked some CSS, learned what I could and couldn't do with 
Markdown, fought the urge to duplicate the __.liquid__ files in the __\_layouts__
directory without gaining anything from it and finally had something I thought 
I could run with.
But now what? I've been working on projects that can safely be called software 
for about 5 years and I've never cemented how to go from local files to 
a live website. ðŸ™ƒ. Where does all that happen? Do I need a hosting account? 
Which one? I've heard the words _Digital Ocean droplet_, that's probably
something... Then I remembered a video I'd been recommended by a friend ages 
ago on [now & next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__b6k2pR3Tg&t=5s), 
Node packages that I didn't really have an application 
at the time. I thought I'd try it out. And damn, __now__ is a super power. 

Here were the steps I took to get my blog up and running during development:
1. Is __now__ still installed? Yep.
1. What does __now -h__ give me, ah __deploy__ seems promising.
1. __now deploy \_site__? Bam! Live website with a generated URL.

Totally, totally, sold, I ended up springing for the step above free account 
so I could associate my custom domains with the deploys and also support 
something that blew my mind.

### Final thoughts
Getting a blog up and running took some leveling up but because of some
great tools it didn't take a ton of time. It was a weekend's work. 
My experiences with both __cobalt.rs__ and __now__ were hugely positive and
I recommend both for anyone interested in starting something from scratch or 
just exploring some new tooling.

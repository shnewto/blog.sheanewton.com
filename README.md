# sheas.blog
personal blog built with hugo.

### Notes
- Some of the Tale theme layout in `themes/tale/layouts/partials/head.html` has been commented out in favor of some of the already generated css. the `now` GitHub integration doesn't seem to allow for the extended hugo build required for the theme (due to this https://github.com/EmielH/tale-hugo/issues/2). Probably worth checking in on it once in awhile to see if we're able to get away with standard hugo again down the road.
